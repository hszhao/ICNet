**Notes**: Model's name that contains phrase 'bnnomerge' is the original trained model, the related one without this phrase is obtained by merging the parameters in batch normlization layers into the closely front convolution layers. When testing the mIoU performance, please choose the related prototxt file. While when testing the inference speed, please choose prototxt without this phrase. That's because the ''Caffe time'' tool runs in training mode while bn layers work in different way as in testing mode (using stored history statistics during testing VS online calculating current batch's statistics during training).
